Recipe CRUD Operations: Users can create, view, edit, and delete recipes. The backend handles these actions through dedicated API endpoints.
Frontend UI: The user interface is developed with React, styled using Tailwind CSS, and focuses on an intuitive and modern design for recipe management, including forms for adding and editing recipes.
Backend API: The backend includes endpoints for user authentication and recipe management, all secured with JWT for protected routes.
Error Handling: Appropriate error handling is implemented for invalid user input, missing author information, and server errors.
